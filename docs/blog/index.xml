      <description>I have spent this summer working on the Discourse project as part of Google Summer of Code. The end result of my project is the discourse-chat-integration plugin.
The &amp;lsquo;Discourse Chatroom Integration Plugin&amp;rsquo; allows sending notifications about new Discourse posts to &amp;lsquo;group chats&amp;rsquo; on a large number of instant messaging platforms including Slack, Telegram, Discord, HipChat, Mattermost, Matrix, Zulip and Rocket Chat. Notifications can be triggered by new topics, new replies, messages to a group, or mentions of a group.</description>

      <description>When running acceptence tests in a continuous integration system, we often need some way to simulate a browser. For some time, PhantomJS has been the go-to option, thanks to its simple API and lightweight nature.
Chrome 59 recently launched with support for &amp;ldquo;headless mode&amp;rdquo;:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless environment. Essentially, running Chrome without chrome! It brings all modern web platform features provided by Chromium and the Blink rendering engine to the command line.</description>
